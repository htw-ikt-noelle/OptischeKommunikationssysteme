    "# Phase noise of lasers\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple Python demo for simulating the [phase noise of a laser](https://www.rp-photonics.com/article_noise_in_laser_technology1.html). The demo was written by [Lutz Molle](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=12017) and [Markus Nölle](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=9586) for a basic course on [optical communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_communication) held at the [University of Applied Sciences (HTW), Berlin](https://ikt-bachelor.htw-berlin.de/studium/labore/uebertragungstechnik/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Details on the underlying theory can be found in, e.g., [Henry, 'Theory of the phase noise and power spectrum of a single mode injection laser',  IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, vol. 19, no. 9, 1983](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1072058), [Franz, 'Optische Übertragungssysteme mit Überlagerungsempfang - Berechnung, Optimierung, Vergleich', Springer, 1988](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-83575-9) and [Barry and Lee, 'Performance of coherent optical receivers', Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 78, no. 8, 1990](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/58322).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coherent systems\n",
    "The [phase noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_noise) of the transmitter [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser) and the [local oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_oscillator) laser in [coherent optical communication systems](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-16-2-753) is one of the dominant sources of [interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(communication)), besides [polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)) instabilities of the involved light waves and various [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(signal_processing)) contributions such as [optical amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_amplifier#Doped_fiber_amplifiers) noise from the transmission line, receiver [shot noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise) as well as [thermal noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_noise) terms of the receiver electronics. Phase noise mainly impacts the [carrier synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_recovery) in coherent communication systems, where a stable phase reference is needed in the [demodulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demodulation) process. In contrast, laser phase noise is less relevant for  [non-coherent detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4063443) systems because either the receiver only measures symbol *energy* (e.g. [OOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On%E2%80%93off_keying), [M-PAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-amplitude_modulation)), or, in differentially-detected phase-modulation systems (e.g. [DPSK, DQPSK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-shift_keying#Differential_phase-shift_keying_(DPSK))), the phase noise only needs to be small enough between two *consecutive* [modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation#Digital_modulation_methods) symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Laser \n",
    "The spectrum of an ideal [continous-wave (CW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser#Continuous_wave_operation) laser is a single spectral line with zero width ([Dirac delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function)), corresponding to a pure [sinusoidal waveform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusoidal_plane_wave#Alternative_representations) at the laser emission frequency. In an actual laser however, the (linear) phase of the sinusoidal waveform is superimposed by small random fluctuations, such that the laser spectrum spreads out slightly to non-zero width.\n",
    "\n",
    "The origin of laser phase noise lies in the physical process of [sponaneous emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_emission) of [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) in the laser gain medium, since spontanuosly emitted photons perturb the phase (and also the amplitude) of the emitted light. This is more critical for semiconductor lasers (in contrast to e.g., higher-power gas lasers) due to the relavively low number of photons ($\\approx10^4$) in the active gain region. Yet, in optical telecommunications, semiconductor lasers ([laser diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_diode)) are predominantly used due to their small size, low cost and matured design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [optical field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_field) at the output of a monomode CW laser can be written in terms of its  (normalized) electrical field vector (ignoring location dependency, i.e. at $z=0$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{E}_{cw}(t)=\\sqrt{P_{s}\\left(t\\right)}\\cdot e^{j\\left(\\omega_{s}t+\\varphi_{s}\\left(t\\right)\\right)}\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_{s}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, $P_{s}$ denotes the laser output power in units of Watts, $t$ is the time variable in seconds, $\\omega_{s}/2\\pi$ is the mean (or nominal) laser emission frequency in units of Hz, $\\varphi_{s}\\left(t\\right)$ is a random process attributed to the residual laser phase noise (randomly fluctuating around the linear phase given by the mean frequency), and $\\mathbf{e}_{s}$ is the unit [Jones vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_calculus) that describes the polarization orientation of the laser's transversal E-field.\n",
    "Here, the laser output power $P_{s}$ is assumed to be constant, whereas in reality, the laser optical field also shows small random amplitude fluctuations ([RIN: relative intensity noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_intensity_noise)) due to spontaneous emission, or due to current source noise. Likewise, the vectorial characterization of field polarization by $\\mathbf{e}$ is omitted as it is not necessary for the description of laser phase noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase noise\n",
    "The phase noise term $\\varphi_{s}\\left(t\\right)$ in the above equation is commonly modeled as a [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk#Relation_to_Wiener_process) or  [Wiener process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process) such that $$\\varphi_{s}\\left(t\\right)=\\intop_{-\\infty}^{t}\\dot{\\varphi}\\left(\\tau\\right)\\mathrm{d}\\tau.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With each time increment $\\mathrm{d}\\tau$, a small phase increment $\\mathrm{d}\\varphi_{s}=\\dot{\\varphi}\\left(\\tau\\right)\\mathrm{d}\\tau$ is added (accumulated) to the current laser phase: $\\varphi_{s}\\left(t+\\mathrm{d}\\tau\\right)=\\varphi_{s}\\left(t\\right)+\\mathrm{d}\\varphi_{s}$. In the Wiener phase noise process, $\\mathrm{d}\\varphi_{s}$ is drawn from a zero-mean [Gaussian random process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) with variance $2\\pi\\thinspace\\Delta\\nu\\thinspace\\mathrm{d}\\tau$. Thus, the Wiener process is completely parameterized by the [*linewidth parameter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_linewidth#Passive_resonator_mode:_Lorentzian_linewidth,_Q-factor,_coherence_time_and_length) $\\Delta\\nu$ (with units of Hz), which is further explained below in the context of the laser spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *single realization* of a Wiener phase noise process ($\\varphi_{s}$ vs. time) is plotted in the figure below (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process)). As usually done and with no loss of generality, the initial phase $\\varphi_{s}\\left(0\\right)$ is set to zero. Note that the random process $\\varphi_{s}\\left(t\\right)$ is a [statistical ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_ensemble_(mathematical_physics)) of (possibly infinitely) many of such realizations, as seen in the random walk ensemble in the upper-left simulation figure at the bottom of this notebook. After time $t$, the [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) of the whole process $\\varphi_{s}$  is given by $\\sigma_{\\varphi_{s}}^{2}\\left(t\\right)=2\\pi\\thinspace\\Delta\\nu\\left|t\\right|$. The variance is linearly increasing in time, making $\\varphi_{s}\\left(t\\right)$ a [non-stationary random process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process). In  the upper-right figure at the bottom of this notebook, the standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\varphi_{s}}\\left(t\\right)$ (theoretical and numerically estimated) of the simulated laser phase noise process is shown.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal derivative $\\dot{\\varphi}\\left(t\\right)$ in the random walk equation can be interpreted as laser *frequency noise* (with units of Hz). Since we used a 'white' Gaussian noise generating process, the frequency noise shows a flat [spectral density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density#Power_spectral_density) $S_{\\dot{\\varphi}}\\left(\\omega\\right)=2\\pi\\thinspace\\Delta\\nu$ (with units of Hz²/Hz), corresponding to a Dirac-delta like [autocorrelation function (ACF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation) $R_{\\dot{\\varphi}}\\left(\\tau\\right)=2\\pi\\thinspace\\Delta\\nu\\thinspace\\delta\\left(\\tau\\right)$, indicating uncorrelated phase increments. In actual lasers though, the PSD of the frequency noise $S_{\\dot{\\varphi}}\\left(\\omega\\right)$ is not necessarily flat as it may contain contributions from e.g., [$1/f$ (flicker) noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_noise) and spectral peaks from laser relaxation oscillations, which then requires more parameters to specify the laser phase noise. In numerical models, an arbitrary (non-white) frequency noise spectrum can be 'designed' by simply filtering the generating white Gaussian noise $\\dot{\\varphi}\\left(t\\right)$ as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power spectrum (PSD) of the CW *optical field* $E_{cw}\\left(t\\right)$ superimposed with Wiener phase noise can be derived (see e.g., Barry1990) as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_{\\mathrm{E}}\\left(\\omega\\right)=\\frac{\\frac{2 P_{s}}{\\pi\\Delta\\nu}}{1+\\left(\\frac{\\omega-\\omega_{s}}{\\pi\\Delta\\nu}\\right)^{2}} .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This spectral shape is referred to as a [Lorentzian](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzkurve) spectrum. As mentioned, the laser phase noise in the simple Wiener model is completely specified by the [linewidth parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_linewidth#Passive_resonator_mode:_Lorentzian_linewidth,_Q-factor,_coherence_time_and_length) $\\Delta\\nu$, which is the [full-width half-maximum (FWHM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_width_at_half_maximum) spectral width (3-dB bandwidth) of the laser PSD. The Lorentzian PSD is plotted togther with the numerically estimated PSD in the lower-right simulation figure an the bottom of this notebook."

    "In this section, a numerical phase noise simulation of an otherwise ideal CW laser is accomplished, according to the simple theory presented above. Three slider controls allow to change the laser linewidth, the total simulation time and the number of random trials to be averaged over. Each time a slider value is changed, an updated simulation is started (upon slider relase). The laser output power is assumed to be 1 mW (0 dBm).\n",

The number of simulated realizations can be set with the 'slider '*no. of trials*'. All phase random walks are normalized to start with $\\varphi_s(t=0) = 0$. With increasing time, they deviate w.r.t each other with an linearly increasing variance. Accordingly, the standard deviation $\\sigma_{φ_s}(t)$ of the phase noise process follows a square-root law, as seen in the upper-right figure.\n",

As there is no amplitude modulation or amplitude noise, the optical field samples are (randomly) arranged on a circle of radius $\\sqrt{P_{s}}$. It follows the phase random walk which is marked as a black line in the upper-left figure. \n",
